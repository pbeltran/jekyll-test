6x05 During the scene when the Night's King was created, the camera
zoomed out to reveal a spiral pattern of rocks surrounding an ancient
weirwood tree. According to showrunner David Benioff, this is one of the
"ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals."

Back in season three episode three, "Walk of Punishment," Jon Snow was
with Mance Rayder and the wildlings. They arrive at the Fist of the
First Men, a landmark in the north where the Night's Watch was attacked
by an army of White Walkers. All that was left behind was the
dismembered corpses of horses, arranged in the spiral pattern seen
above. "Always the artists," Mance said upon seeing the arrangement.
This pattern is not mentioned in the books, so previously we weren't
sure what its significance was. Now — thanks to Bran's visions — we know
it's somehow associated with the magic of the Children.
